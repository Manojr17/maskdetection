Project Description:

-The Mask Detection Program is an AI-powered system designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time or from images.

-Built using TensorFlow (Keras) for deep learning and OpenCV for image processing, this model helps automate mask compliance monitoring, which is essential for public health and
safety in various environments such as offices, schools, and public transport.

Recommended Installation Commands:

      pip install tensorflow==2.14.0
      pip install opencv-python==4.8.0.76
      pip install numpy==1.23.5
      pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2

You can adjust versions slightly as per compatibility with your system, but these are stable and widely used for AI & CV projects.
